You are playing a navigation game in MS-DOS. The game shows a 2D grid-based maze where you control a red square that must reach a green square goal.

Game Objective:
- There are 10 stages of increasing difficulty
- Each stage shows a new maze layout
- Navigate the red square to reach the green square goal
- You can only move on light colored tiles
- Dark tiles represent walls that cannot be crossed
- Game ends after completing all 10 stages

Controls:
- Use the arrow keys to move the red square one tile at a time:
  - Up arrow: Move up one tile
  - Down arrow: Move down one tile
  - Left arrow: Move left one tile 
  - Right arrow: Move right one tile
- You cannot move onto dark colored tiles
- You must find a valid path from start to goal using only light colored tiles
- If you get stuck, you may need to restart the stage

Your goal is to complete all 10 stages by carefully navigating through each maze. Plan your route to avoid walls and find the optimal path from start to finish.
